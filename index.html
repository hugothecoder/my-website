            <p>I created my first website today using only html with nothing on the backend. Very interesting how so much of the web started with this. Makes me wonder how much inovation has changed since then.</p>

            <p>Passed a quiz today. Expanding on the idea of a habit tracker i was thinking of having a screen at home that could show how many of the list had been completed and maybe have to finish a score of 80% Interesting thoughts. Signing off.</p>

            <p>Completed one of my first chapters of the 11 total! Feeling accomplished! Time to keep on grinding. Tidbit of information I learned today is having desires takes away peace aka happiness until you get it. Less desires equals more happiness. Minimalism for the win! Signing off! </p>

            <p class="meta">Posted on september 15 </p>
            <p>Getting to the point ever day more and more that materealistic things arent as important to me. Paying debt off and lowering my monthly expensis is going well. Time to focus more how I can change the world for the better. Listened to jeff bezoz talk about how creating space collonies would be far more benificial that just making another brand just to make money. Love the idea of helping the world. I know mind body and spirit are also ways to heal. Logging off!</p>

            <p>Random thought. The idea that something like eth could be over taken if a super computer was used to mine it and access it with 25% and take complete control at 50 seems like such a flaw in the disgn. Not a pro in crypto but seems like there is still so much growth in the space. Like the idea of something like xrp with such low gas fees mixed with bitcoins limited supply with the attributes of having contracts that could possible be used for contracts. Logging off!</p>
